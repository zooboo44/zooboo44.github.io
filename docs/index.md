# Purpose

This site is a portfolio of my work in homelab development, technology projects, and computer science. It documents my progress, showcases technical skills, and highlights areas of exploration and experimentation. The goal is to provide a clear record of my capabilities, interests, and growth as I continue building, learning, and refining my expertise.
